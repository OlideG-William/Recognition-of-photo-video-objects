In order to launch the project, you need to take the following steps:

First install these packages:
{

	* qt5-applications          5.15.2.2.3
	* qt5-tools                 5.15.2.1.3
	* PyQt5                     5.15.9
	* pyqt5-plugins             5.15.9.2.3
	* PyQt5-Qt5                 5.15.2
	* PyQt5-sip                 12.11.1
	* pyqt5-tools               5.15.9.3.3
	* opencv-contrib-python     4.7.0.72
	* opencv-python             4.7.0.72
	* numpy                     1.24.2
 
}

Next, you need to install Python itself of the appropriate version:

Python 3.11.2

P.S.: Regarding python and version, incompatibility is possible with some packages,  if using a late version of python. Comments in the code are in Ukrainian, over time I will correct them in English
